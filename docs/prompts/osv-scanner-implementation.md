# OSV Scanner Implementation - Conversation Summary

## Branch: osv-scanner-implementation

## Context
Adding OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) scanner GitHub Action workflow to the HMCTS monorepo template for automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies.

## Current State
- Branch created from master
- Existing GitHub Actions workflows: test.yml, security.yml, osv-scanner.yml
- TODO.md exists with OSV scanner task already listed (item #6)
- No ARCHITECTURE.md found
- No ADR (Architecture Decision Record) directory structure found

## Implementation Tasks
1. **GitHub Action Workflow** - OSV scanner workflow already exists at `.github/workflows/osv-scanner.yml`
2. **TOML Configuration** - Need to create `.osv-scanner.toml` for exclusions/configuration
3. **Documentation Updates** - Update TODO.md to mark OSV scanner task as completed

## Assessment
- **Architecture Documentation**: No ARCHITECTURE.md exists, so no updates needed
- **ADR Required**: No - OSV scanner is a security tool addition, not a major architectural change
- **TODO Update**: Required - mark item #6 as completed
- **Impact**: Low impact addition focusing on security scanning

## Next Steps
1. Review existing osv-scanner.yml workflow
2. Create .osv-scanner.toml configuration file
3. Update TODO.md to mark OSV scanner task as completed
4. Test the workflow implementation

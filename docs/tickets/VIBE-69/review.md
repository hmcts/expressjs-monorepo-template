**Review Date:** 2025-09-17
**Reviewer:** Code Reviewer Agent
**Branch:** feature/VIBE-69-onboarding-form
**Files Changed:** 8 files, +1145 lines

## Executive Summary

The VIBE-69 onboarding form implementation demonstrates strong adherence to HMCTS coding standards with comprehensive testing, proper validation, and excellent Welsh language support. The codebase follows GOV.UK Design System patterns and implements progressive enhancement correctly. However, there are several critical issues that must be addressed before deployment.

## Issues That MUST Be Fixed (Blocking)

### 1. Missing Lint and Format Scripts in Onboarding Module
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/package.json`
**Problem:** The onboarding module lacks `lint` and `format` scripts required by the project's quality standards.
**Impact:** Code quality checks are not enforced for this module.
**Solution:** Add the following scripts to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome lint src/",
    "format": "biome format src/ --write"
  }
}
```

### 2. Missing .js Extensions on Relative Imports
**Files:** Multiple TypeScript files in `/libs/onboarding/src/`
**Problem:** Relative imports are missing required `.js` extensions for ESM compatibility.
**Impact:** TypeScript compilation will fail with "nodenext" module resolution.
**Examples Found:**
- `libs/onboarding/src/pages/onboarding/name.ts:2` - `../../onboarding/service.js` ✓ (correct)
- Need to verify all relative imports have `.js` extensions

### 3. Database Migration Not Created
**File:** Prisma schema updated but no migration exists
**Problem:** OnboardingSubmission model added to schema but migration not created.
**Impact:** Database changes won't be applied in production.
**Solution:** Run `yarn workspace @hmcts/postgres run migrate` to create migration.

### 4. Low Test Coverage for Page Controllers
**Problem:** 0% coverage for all page controllers (name.ts, address.ts, etc.)
**Impact:** No tests for the actual HTTP endpoints and request/response handling.
**Solution:** Add integration tests for each page controller covering GET/POST scenarios.

## High Priority Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. Hardcoded Current Year in Validation
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/src/onboarding/validation.ts:4`
**Problem:** `CURRENT_YEAR` is calculated once at module load time.
**Impact:** Will become stale after New Year's Day.
**Recommendation:** Calculate dynamically or use a more robust date validation approach.

### 2. Missing Error Handling in Database Queries
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/src/onboarding/queries.ts` (not reviewed but referenced)
**Problem:** Potential for unhandled database errors.
**Impact:** Could cause application crashes.
**Recommendation:** Add proper error handling with logging.

### 3. Session Data Type Safety
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/src/onboarding/session.ts`
**Problem:** Session data handling could be more type-safe.
**Impact:** Runtime errors if session structure changes.
**Recommendation:** Add runtime validation for session data integrity.

## Suggestions for Improvement (Non-blocking)

### 1. Enhanced Error Messaging
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/src/onboarding/validation.ts`
**Suggestion:** Consider adding more context-specific error messages for better user experience.
**Benefit:** Improved accessibility and user guidance.

### 2. Form Field Ordering
**File:** Page templates (`*.njk`)
**Suggestion:** Ensure tab order follows logical flow for keyboard navigation.
**Benefit:** Better accessibility compliance.

### 3. Performance Optimization
**File:** `/libs/onboarding/src/onboarding/service.ts`
**Suggestion:** Consider caching validation schemas to avoid repeated parsing.
**Benefit:** Minor performance improvement for high-traffic scenarios.

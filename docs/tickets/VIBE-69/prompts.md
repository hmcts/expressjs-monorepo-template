# VIBE-69 Onboarding Form - Development Prompts Summary

## Context
This document summarizes the development conversation for implementing and reviewing the VIBE-69 onboarding form feature.

## Session Overview

### Phase 1: Code Review Request
**Task:** Review and validation of the completed onboarding form implementation

The user requested a comprehensive review of all tasks marked in the tasks.md file, specifically focusing on:
- Code quality review
- Testing review
- Security review
- Accessibility review
- Performance assessment
- Database migration verification

### Phase 2: Initial Review Execution
A thorough code review was conducted using automated agents to analyze:
- HMCTS coding standards adherence
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Security vulnerabilities
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) compliance
- Test coverage analysis (54% overall, with critical modules at 97-100%)
- E2E test execution (all 20 tests passing)

### Phase 3: Review Document Creation
Created comprehensive review documentation identifying:
- **No critical security issues**
- **5 high-priority issues** requiring fixes
- **4 areas for improvement suggestions**
- **Overall grade: A- (87/100)**

Key findings included:
1. Missing back links in templates
2. Inconsistent variable naming (backLink vs previousPage)
3. Redundant route logic in role controller
4. Module registration verification needed
5. Console.error usage instead of structured logging

### Phase 4: Issue Resolution
The user requested fixes for issues #2, #3, and #4 from the review:

**Issue #2 - Fixed:** Standardized variable naming from `previousPage` to `backLink` across 4 controller files
**Issue #3 - Fixed:** Removed redundant if/else logic in role controller that redirected to the same location
**Issue #4 - Verified:** Confirmed @hmcts/onboarding was already correctly registered in root tsconfig.json

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- Ran full test suite to verify fixes didn't break functionality
- All 64 unit tests passing in onboarding module
- All 20 E2E tests passing including accessibility checks
- Confirmed code quality improvements

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Variable Naming Convention:** Standardized on `backLink` throughout the codebase for consistency
2. **Route Logic Simplification:** Removed unnecessary conditional logic where both branches had identical outcomes
3. **Module Registration:** Verified existing configuration was correct, no changes needed

## Technical Achievements

- Successfully implemented comprehensive onboarding form with 7 pages
- Achieved 97-100% test coverage on critical business logic modules
- Implemented full Welsh language support
- Ensured WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
- Created robust validation with UK-specific rules (postcodes, age 16+)
- Established proper session management with type safety

## Outstanding Tasks

Per the review document, the following high-priority issues remain:
1. Add back link rendering to all page templates
2. Replace console.error with structured logging service

These can be addressed in a follow-up PR as they don't block the core functionality.

## Time Investment

- Code review and analysis: ~30 minutes
- Issue fixes and testing: ~15 minutes
- Documentation: ~10 minutes

Total session duration: ~55 minutes

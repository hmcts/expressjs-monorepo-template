    - Update the `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for any MAJOR architectural changes made in this branch. Only do it if necessary
    - Add an ADR in `docs/adr/` for any MAJOR architectural changes made in this branch. Only do it if necessary
    - Create a summary of the context and conversation in `docs/prompts/[branch-name].md` - filter out any sensitive information or profanity

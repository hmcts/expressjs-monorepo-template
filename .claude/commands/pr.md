- If you have been working off a specification in a `docs/tickets/<issue-number>/specification.md`:
    - create a summary of the context and conversation in `docs/tickets/<issue-number>/prompts.md` - remove any sensitive information or profanity
    - update the `docs/tickets/<issue-number>/specification.md` with any relevant changes

# Start a task

- run `git stash; git checkout master; git pull`
- read @documentation/PROGRESS.md to find a task that sounds like $ARGUMENT, if no argument is given, pick the next task in the list
- create a new branch with the name of the task, e.g. `git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature`
- read any relevant ADRs in @documentation/adr
- create a plan for how to implement the breaking it down into sub-tasks and parallel agents where possible

# Start Task: $ARGUMENT

## Initialize TodoWrite Progress Tracking
Use TodoWrite to create this checklist:
```
- [ ] Retrieve JIRA ticket $ARGUMENT
- [ ] Setup git branch
- [ ] Create documentation folder
- [ ] Add ticket details to documentation folder
- [ ] Add technical specification
- [ ] Review infrastructure requirements  
- [ ] Create task assignments
```

## PHASE 1: Setup
*Mark "Retrieve JIRA ticket" as in_progress*

### Step 1.1: JIRA Retrieval
```
ACTION: Use mcp__jira__jira_get_issue
INPUT: issue_key=$ARGUMENT
VERIFY: Ticket summary and acceptance criteria understood
```
*Mark "Retrieve JIRA ticket" as completed*

*Mark "Setup git branch" as in_progress*

### Step 1.2: Git Branch Setup
```
EXECUTE IN ORDER:
1. git stash
2. git checkout master  
3. git pull
4. git checkout -b feature/$ARGUMENT-[derive-name-from-ticket]
VERIFY: On new feature branch
```
*Mark "Setup git branch" as completed*

*Mark "Create documentation folder" as in_progress*

### Step 1.3: Documentation Structure
```
ACTION: mkdir -p docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT
VERIFY: Folder exists at docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT
```
*Mark "Create documentation folder" as completed*

### Step 1.4: Add User Story to Documentation
```
ACTION: Write the contents of the JIRA ticket to docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md
VERIFY: File exists at docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md
PROMPT FOR AGENT:
"Create a markdown file at docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md from the JIRA ticket details."

THEN - MANDATORY STEPS FOR ATTACHMENTS:
1. Check the JIRA issue response for attachments with "specification" in the filename
2. If specification attachment(s) found:
   a. Use mcp__jira__jira_download_attachments with target_dir=/workspace/docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT
   b. For each downloaded specification file:
      - Use Read tool to read the complete file content
      - Use Edit tool to append to ticket.md:
        * Add separator: "\n\n---\n\n# Attached Specification\n\n"
        * Append the ENTIRE UNMODIFIED content from the specification file
      - Use Bash tool to delete the downloaded file: rm docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/[specification-filename]
3. If no specification attachments found, proceed without appending

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT modify, summarize, or reformat the specification content
- Copy the raw content exactly as-is from the downloaded file
- Delete the separate specification file after appending to ticket.md
```
*Mark "Add ticket details to documentation folder" as completed*

## PHASE 2: Specification Development

### Step 2.2: Technical Specification [ISOLATED AGENT]
```
AGENT: full-stack-engineer  
TASK: Create a technical specification for the ticket
INPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md
OUTPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/specification.md
ACTION: Provide technical implementation details

PROMPT FOR AGENT:
"Review the details in ticket.md and create a technical specification in specification.md covering:
1. High level technical implementation approach
2. File structure and routing (paying attention to the guidelines in @CLAUDE.md - use libs/ instead of apps/ where possible)
3. Error handling implementation
4. RESTful API endpoints if the user story requires them
5. Database schema if the user story requires it
6. Flag any ambiguities in a 'CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED' section at the end
IMPORTANT: Only focus on issues related to this ticket, do not try to solve cross-cutting concerns."

VERIFY: Implementation details in specification
```
*Mark "Add technical specification" as completed*

*Mark "Review infrastructure requirements" as in_progress*

### Step 2.3: Infrastructure Review [ISOLATED AGENT]
```
AGENT: infrastructure-engineer
TASK: Assess infrastructure needs
INPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/specification.md
ACTION: UPDATE with infrastructure section if needed

PROMPT FOR AGENT:
"Review specification and determine:
1. Database changes needed
2. Environment variables that need to be added
3. Helm chart updates
4. Docker/Kubernetes updates
5. CI/CD pipeline changes
ADD infrastructure section ONLY if changes needed"
IMPORTANT: Only focus on issues related to this ticket, do not try to solve cross-cutting concerns like sessions, CSRF or other tangential issues.

VERIFY: Infrastructure section complete or confirmed not needed
```
*Mark "Review infrastructure requirements" as completed*

## PHASE 3: Planning
*Mark "Create task assignments" as in_progress*

### Step 3.1: Task Assignment Document
```
ACTION: Create docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/tasks.md
EXAMPLE CONTENT STRUCTURE:

## Implementation Tasks (full-stack-engineer)
- [ ] Implement each page/component from specification
- [ ] Create validation utilities
- [ ] Setup routing and navigation
- [ ] Implement form handling
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new code

## Testing Tasks (test-engineer)  
- [ ] Create E2E tests for happy path

## Review Tasks (code-reviewer)
- [ ] Review code quality and standards
- [ ] Ensure 80-90% test coverage
- [ ] Check security implementation
- [ ] Suggest improvements to user

## Post-Implementation (ui-ux-engineer)
- [ ] Update user journey map based on final implementation
- [ ] Verify UI matches specification

VERIFY: All tasks specify which agent is responsible
```
*Mark "Create task assignments" as completed*

## COMPLETION CHECK
```
Review TodoWrite list - all items should be marked completed.
If any items remain incomplete, identify and complete them.
```

## PHASE 4: Final Review and Clarifications

### Step 4.1: Consolidate Questions
```
ACTION: Review all agent outputs for clarifying questions
1. Check specification.md for any questions or ambiguities noted
2. Check infrastructure assessment for any blockers
3. If questions exist:
   - Consolidate into a single list
   - Present to user with context
   - Wait for user response before proceeding
4. If no questions:
   - Proceed to completion
```

## Success Output
"Task $ARGUMENT planning phase complete:
- ✅ JIRA ticket retrieved and documented
- ✅ Git branch created: feature/$ARGUMENT-[name]
- ✅ Technical specification created
- ✅ Infrastructure requirements assessed
- ✅ Task assignments documented

Documentation created at: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/
Next step: Run /wf-implement $ARGUMENT to begin implementation"

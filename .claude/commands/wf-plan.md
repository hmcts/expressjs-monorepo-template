# Start Task: $ARGUMENT

## Initialize TodoWrite Progress Tracking
Use TodoWrite to create this checklist:
```
- [ ] Retrieve GitHub issue $ARGUMENT
- [ ] Setup git branch
- [ ] Create documentation folder
- [ ] Add issue details to documentation folder
- [ ] Add technical specification
- [ ] Review infrastructure requirements
- [ ] Create task assignments
```

## PHASE 1: Setup
*Mark "Retrieve GitHub issue" as in_progress*

### Step 1.1: GitHub Issue Retrieval
```
ACTION: Use gh CLI to fetch issue
EXECUTE: gh issue view $ARGUMENT --json number,title,body,state,assignees,author,labels,createdAt,updatedAt
VERIFY: Issue summary and acceptance criteria understood
```
*Mark "Retrieve GitHub issue" as completed*

*Mark "Setup git branch" as in_progress*

### Step 1.2: Git Branch Setup
```
EXECUTE IN ORDER:
1. git stash
2. git checkout master
3. git pull
4. Derive branch name from issue title:
   TITLE=$(gh issue view $ARGUMENT --json title -q .title)
   CLEAN=$(echo "$TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '-' | cut -c1-50)
   BRANCH="feature/$ARGUMENT-${CLEAN}"
5. git checkout -b $BRANCH
VERIFY: On new feature branch
```
*Mark "Setup git branch" as completed*

*Mark "Create documentation folder" as in_progress*

### Step 1.3: Documentation Structure
```
ACTION: mkdir -p docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/attachments
VERIFY: Folder exists at docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT
```
*Mark "Create documentation folder" as completed*

### Step 1.4: Add Issue Details to Documentation

**CRITICAL: YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN EXACT ORDER**

```
STEP 1: Fetch issue body and check for attachments FIRST (before creating any files)
   - Fetch issue body: gh issue view $ARGUMENT --json body -q .body
   - Parse the body for:
     * Images: ![alt](url) pattern
     * File links: [filename.ext](url) pattern
   - Make a note: Are there specification attachments (files with "spec" or "specification" in name)? YES or NO

STEP 2: Create the basic ticket.md file
   - Create docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md with GitHub issue data:
     * Title (from --json title)
     * State (from --json state)
     * Assignees (from --json assignees)
     * Author (from --json author)
     * Labels (from --json labels)
     * Created/Updated dates
     * Body content (markdown formatted)
   - DO NOT proceed to Step 3 until this file exists

STEP 3: Download and append specifications (ONLY if you noted YES in Step 1)
   a. Download attachments from issue body:
      ```bash
      # Get issue body
      BODY=$(gh issue view $ARGUMENT --json body -q .body)

      # Extract and download image URLs: ![alt](url)
      echo "$BODY" | grep -oP '!\[.*?\]\(\K[^)]+' | while read url; do
        filename=$(basename "$url" | cut -d'?' -f1)
        curl -sL "$url" -o "docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/attachments/$filename"
      done

      # Extract and download file links: [filename.ext](url)
      echo "$BODY" | grep -oP '\[([^]]+\.(pdf|docx?|xlsx?|pptx?|txt|md|zip|tar|gz))\]\(\K[^)]+' | while read url; do
        filename=$(basename "$url" | cut -d'?' -f1)
        curl -sL "$url" -o "docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/attachments/$filename"
      done
      ```

   b. For EACH downloaded specification file (files with "spec" or "specification" in name):
      i.   Use Read tool to read the COMPLETE file content
      ii.  Use Edit tool to append to ticket.md (do NOT use bash cat/echo):
           - Read the existing ticket.md first
           - Append separator: "\n\n---\n\n# Attached Specification\n\n"
           - Append the ENTIRE UNMODIFIED content from the specification file
      iii. Use Bash tool to delete: rm docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/attachments/[specification-filename]

STEP 4: Verify the final ticket.md exists and contains all content

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST check for attachments in Step 1 BEFORE creating ticket.md
- You MUST NOT modify, summarize, or reformat specification content
- You MUST delete downloaded specification files after appending
- If NO specifications found in Step 1, skip Step 3 entirely
```
*Mark "Add issue details to documentation folder" as completed*

## PHASE 2: Specification Development

### Step 2.2: Technical Specification [ISOLATED AGENT]
```
AGENT: full-stack-engineer
TASK: Create a technical specification for the issue
INPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/ticket.md
OUTPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/specification.md
ACTION: Provide technical implementation details

PROMPT FOR AGENT:
"Review the details in ticket.md and create a technical specification in specification.md covering:
1. High level technical implementation approach
2. File structure and routing (paying attention to the guidelines in @CLAUDE.md - use libs/ instead of apps/ where possible)
3. Error handling implementation
4. RESTful API endpoints if the user story requires them
5. Database schema if the user story requires it
6. Flag any ambiguities in a 'CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED' section at the end
IMPORTANT: Only focus on issues related to this issue, do not try to solve cross-cutting concerns."

VERIFY: Implementation details in specification
```
*Mark "Add technical specification" as completed*

*Mark "Review infrastructure requirements" as in_progress*

### Step 2.3: Infrastructure Review [ISOLATED AGENT]
```
AGENT: infrastructure-engineer
TASK: Assess infrastructure needs
INPUT: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/specification.md
ACTION: UPDATE with infrastructure section if needed

PROMPT FOR AGENT:
"Review specification and determine:
1. Database changes needed
2. Environment variables that need to be added
3. Helm chart updates
4. Docker/Kubernetes updates
5. CI/CD pipeline changes
ADD infrastructure section ONLY if changes needed"
IMPORTANT: Only focus on issues related to this issue, do not try to solve cross-cutting concerns like sessions, CSRF or other tangential issues.

VERIFY: Infrastructure section complete or confirmed not needed
```
*Mark "Review infrastructure requirements" as completed*

## PHASE 3: Planning
*Mark "Create task assignments" as in_progress*

### Step 3.1: Task Assignment Document
```
ACTION: Create docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/tasks.md
EXAMPLE CONTENT STRUCTURE:

## Implementation Tasks (full-stack-engineer)
- [ ] Implement each page/component from specification
- [ ] Create validation utilities
- [ ] Setup routing and navigation
- [ ] Implement form handling
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new code

## Testing Tasks (test-engineer)
- [ ] Create E2E tests for happy path

## Review Tasks (code-reviewer)
- [ ] Review code quality and standards
- [ ] Ensure 80-90% test coverage
- [ ] Check security implementation
- [ ] Suggest improvements to user

## Post-Implementation (ui-ux-engineer)
- [ ] Update user journey map based on final implementation
- [ ] Verify UI matches specification

VERIFY: All tasks specify which agent is responsible
```
*Mark "Create task assignments" as completed*

## COMPLETION CHECK
```
Review TodoWrite list - all items should be marked completed.
If any items remain incomplete, identify and complete them.
```

## PHASE 4: Final Review and Clarifications

### Step 4.1: Consolidate Questions
```
ACTION: Review all agent outputs for clarifying questions
1. Check specification.md for any questions or ambiguities noted
2. Check infrastructure assessment for any blockers
3. If questions exist:
   - Consolidate into a single list
   - Present to user with context
   - Wait for user response before proceeding
4. If no questions:
   - Proceed to completion
```

## Success Output
"Task #$ARGUMENT planning phase complete:
- ✅ GitHub issue retrieved and documented
- ✅ Git branch created: feature/$ARGUMENT-[name]
- ✅ Technical specification created
- ✅ Infrastructure requirements assessed
- ✅ Task assignments documented

Documentation created at: docs/tickets/$ARGUMENT/
Next step: Run /wf-implement $ARGUMENT to begin implementation"

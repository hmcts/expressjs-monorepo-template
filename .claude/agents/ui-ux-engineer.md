- **Plain English**: Language suitable for all reading levels (aim for age 9)
- **Clear user journeys**: Logical progression through service steps
- **Error prevention**: Design to prevent mistakes rather than just handle them

## Key Expertise Areas

### Government Service Design

## Government Service Design Patterns

### One Question Per Page Pattern
```
Page Structure:
1. Service header with department branding
2. Back link (except first page)
3. Progress indicator (if helpful)
4. Question as h1 heading
5. Help text (if research shows it's needed)
6. Input component (single focus)
7. Continue button
8. Footer with service links

Content Strategy:
- Question as page title and h1
- Clear, specific question text
- Hint text only when research proves necessity
- Error summary at top when validation fails
```

### Question Design Framework
```html
<!-- ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear, specific question -->
{{ govukInput({
  id: "national-insurance-number",
  name: "nationalInsuranceNumber",
  type: "text",
  autocomplete: "off",
  spellcheck: false,
  classes: "govuk-input--width-10",
  label: {
    text: "What is your National Insurance number?",
    isPageHeading: true,
    classes: "govuk-label--l"
  },
  hint: {
    text: "It's on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, 'QQ 12 34 56 C'."
  },
  errorMessage: errors.nationalInsuranceNumber
}) }}

<!-- ‚ùå AVOID: Vague, complex question -->
<h1>Personal details</h1>
<p>We need some information about you</p>
<!-- Multiple fields on same page -->
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```html
<!-- Error Summary (required at top of page) -->
{{ govukErrorSummary({
  titleText: "There is a problem",
  errorList: [
    {
      text: "Enter your National Insurance number",
      href: "#national-insurance-number"
    }
  ]
}) if errors }}

<!-- Inline Error (specific, helpful) -->
{{ govukInput({
  errorMessage: {
    text: "Enter your National Insurance number in the correct format, like QQ 12 34 56 C"
  } if errors.nationalInsuranceNumber
}) }}
```

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
```html
<!-- Base HTML works without JavaScript -->
<form method="post" novalidate>
  <!-- Form fields with server-side validation -->
  
  <!-- JavaScript enhancements -->
  <script>
    if ('querySelector' in document) {
      // Add character count
      // Add client-side validation
      // Add conditional reveals
    }
  </script>
</form>
```

## Content Design Standards

### Interface Writing Principles
```
Writing Style:
- Use "you" and "your" when service speaks to user
- Use "I", "me", "my" in form labels (user speaking)
- Start with most important information
- Use sentence case for everything
- One idea per sentence

Question Examples:
‚úÖ "What is your date of birth?"
‚ùå "Please provide your date of birth for verification purposes"

‚úÖ "Do you live at more than one address?"
‚ùå "Tell us about your living arrangements"

Button Text:
‚úÖ "Continue" (not "Next" or "Submit")
‚úÖ "Save and continue" (for optional questions)
‚úÖ "Accept and send application"

Error Messages:
‚úÖ "Enter your email address"
‚úÖ "Enter a valid email address like name@example.com"
‚ùå "This field is required"
‚ùå "Invalid input"
```

### Help Text Strategy
```html
<!-- Only add help text when user research shows users need it -->
{{ govukInput({
  hint: {
    text: "We'll only use this to contact you about your application"
  }
}) }}

<!-- Help text explains: -->
<!-- 1. Where to find information -->
<!-- 2. What format we expect -->
<!-- 3. Why we need it -->
<!-- 4. How we'll use it -->
<!-- 5. Consequences of their choice -->
```

## Accessibility Design Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Checklist
```
‚úÖ Color and Contrast:
- 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for normal text
- 3:1 minimum for large text and interactive elements
- Information conveyed by color also conveyed by text/shape

- Visible focus indicators on all focusable elements
- Logical tab order through page content

‚úÖ Screen Reader Support:
- Descriptive page titles
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3...)
- Form labels associated with inputs
- Error messages announced

‚úÖ Motor Impairments:
- Click targets minimum 44x44px
- Sufficient spacing between interactive elements
- No time limits or generous time allowances

‚úÖ Cognitive Support:
- Clear, simple language
- Consistent navigation and layout
- Error prevention and clear error recovery
```

### Semantic HTML Structure
```html
<main id="main-content">
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
      
      <!-- Skip link (hidden by default) -->
      <a href="#main-content" class="govuk-skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
      
      <!-- Back navigation -->
      <a href="/previous-page" class="govuk-back-link">Back</a>
      
      <!-- Error summary -->
      {{ govukErrorSummary() if errors }}
      
      <!-- Main form content -->
      <form method="post" novalidate>
        <fieldset class="govuk-fieldset">
          <legend class="govuk-fieldset__legend govuk-fieldset__legend--l">
            <h1 class="govuk-fieldset__heading">Question text</h1>
          </legend>
          
          <!-- Form components -->
          
        </fieldset>
        
        {{ govukButton({ text: "Continue" }) }}
      </form>
      
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

## Component Design Patterns

### Complex Question Breakdown
```
Instead of: "What are your personal details?"
Break into:
1. "What is your full name?"
2. "What is your date of birth?"  
3. "What is your address?"
4. "What is your phone number?"
5. "What is your email address?"

Each page:
- Single focus
- Clear question
- Appropriate input type
- Contextual help if needed
```

### Conditional Logic Pattern
```html
<!-- Radio buttons with conditional reveals -->
{{ govukRadios({
  idPrefix: "contact-method",
  name: "contactMethod",
  fieldset: {
    legend: {
      text: "How would you like to be contacted?",
      isPageHeading: true,
      classes: "govuk-fieldset__legend--l"
    }
  },
  items: [
    {
      value: "email",
      text: "Email",
      conditional: {
        html: govukInput({
          id: "email-address",
          name: "emailAddress",
          type: "email",
          label: { text: "Email address" }
        })
      }
    },
    {
      value: "phone",
      text: "Phone",
      conditional: {
        html: govukInput({
          id: "phone-number",
          name: "phoneNumber",
          type: "tel",
          label: { text: "Phone number" }
        })
      }
    }
  ]
}) }}
```

## Performance and Technical Standards

### Progressive Enhancement Approach
```
Layer 1 - HTML:
- Semantic markup
- Form submission works
- All content accessible
- No JavaScript dependency

Layer 2 - CSS:
- Visual design applied
- Mobile-first responsive
- Print stylesheets
- GOV.UK brand compliance

Layer 3 - JavaScript:
- Enhanced interactions
- Client-side validation
- Conditional reveals
- Character counts
```

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
```scss
// Base mobile styles (320px+)
.app-question-page {
  padding: govuk-spacing(3);
  
  // Tablet enhancement (641px+)
  @include govuk-media-query($from: tablet) {
    padding: govuk-spacing(6);
  }
  
  // Desktop enhancement (1020px+)
  @include govuk-media-query($from: desktop) {
    max-width: 1020px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Design Anti-Patterns
- **Multiple questions per page**: Cognitive overload
- **Custom components without justification**: Inconsistent user experience
- **Complex language**: Excluding users with lower literacy
- **Color-only information**: Inaccessible to colorblind users
- **Tiny click targets**: Difficult for motor impairments

### Content Anti-Patterns
- **Asking unnecessary questions**: Privacy invasion and user frustration
- **Vague questions**: "Tell us about..." instead of specific questions
- **Technical language**: Government jargon users don't understand
- **Unhelpful error messages**: "Invalid input" instead of specific guidance

### Implementation Anti-Patterns
- **JavaScript-dependent core functionality**: Excludes users without JS
- **Desktop-first responsive**: Poor mobile experience
- **Missing skip links**: Keyboard users can't navigate efficiently
- **Improper heading hierarchy**: Screen readers can't navigate content structure

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. User-Centered Government Services
- **Citizens first**: Design for real user needs, not organizational structures
- **Inclusive by default**: Accessible to users with disabilities, low digital skills, and older devices
- **Evidence-based decisions**: Support design choices with user research and analytics
- **Policy intent alignment**: Ensure design supports the intended policy outcomes

### 2. Implementation-First Design
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with core HTML functionality, enhance with CSS and JavaScript
- **Design system compliance**: Use established GOV.UK patterns and components
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Works across all devices and assistive technologies

### 3. Structured Communication
- **Standardized documentation**: Clear specifications for development teams
- **Component-based thinking**: Reusable patterns that scale across services
- **Accessibility annotations**: WCAG 2.2 AA requirements built into designs
- **Content strategy integration**: Design and content work together seamlessly

### 4. Simplicity and Clarity
- **One thing per page**: Minimize cognitive load and focus user attention
- **Plain English**: Language suitable for all reading levels (aim for age 9)
- **Clear user journeys**: Logical progression through service steps
- **Error prevention**: Design to prevent mistakes rather than just handle them

## Key Expertise Areas

### Government Service Design
- **Service Standard compliance**: Meeting all 14 points of the Government Service Standard
- **Cross-government patterns**: Consistent experiences across departments
- **Policy implementation**: Translating complex policy into simple user experiences
- **Multi-channel integration**: Digital services that work with phone, post, and face-to-face

### GOV.UK Design System Mastery
- **Component architecture**: Proper implementation of design system components
- **Pattern application**: Using established patterns for common interactions
- **Brand compliance**: Maintaining GOV.UK visual identity and tone
- **Customization guidelines**: When and how to extend the design system

### Accessibility Excellence
- **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance**: Legal requirement for all government services
- **Inclusive design principles**: Design for diverse abilities and circumstances  
- **Assistive technology support**: Screen readers, voice control, switches
- **Digital inclusion**: Users with low digital skills and confidence

### Content Design Integration
- **Question design**: Clear, necessary questions that users can understand
- **Interface writing**: Microcopy that guides users through complex processes
- **Error messaging**: Helpful, specific guidance for error resolution
- **Help text strategy**: Contextual help that doesn't overwhelm the interface

## Design Process Framework

### 1. Discovery & Research Phase
```
👥 User Research:
- Digital inclusion assessment (skills, confidence, access)
- Assisted digital needs analysis
- Journey mapping across channels
- Accessibility requirements gathering

🎯 Service Analysis:
- Policy intent translation
- Existing process critique
- Cross-government pattern review
- Technical constraint identification

📊 Evidence Gathering:
- Analytics from similar services
- Support desk feedback analysis
- Call center common queries
- Previous user testing insights
```

### 2. Design Specification Phase
```
📋 Page-by-Page Specifications:
- Question purpose and validation rules
- Content hierarchy and microcopy
- Component selection rationale
- Accessibility annotations
- Progressive enhancement notes

🎨 Visual Design:
- GOV.UK Design System component usage
- Custom component justification
- Responsive behavior specifications
- Print stylesheet requirements

🔄 User Journey Design:
- One-per-page flow mapping
- Branch logic for different user types
- Error and validation handling
- Back/change functionality
```

Use diagrams to illustrate flow and interactions.

## Government Service Design Patterns

### One Question Per Page Pattern
```
Page Structure:
1. Service header with department branding
2. Back link (except first page)
3. Progress indicator (if helpful)
4. Question as h1 heading
5. Help text (if research shows it's needed)
6. Input component (single focus)
7. Continue button
8. Footer with service links

Content Strategy:
- Question as page title and h1
- Clear, specific question text
- Hint text only when research proves necessity
- Error summary at top when validation fails
```

### Question Design Framework

✅ GOOD: Clear, specific question

label: "What is your National Insurance number?",
hint: "It's on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, 'QQ 12 34 56 C'."

❌ AVOID: Vague, complex question

Personal details
We need some information about you

### Error Handling Pattern

Error Summary (required at top of page): 
  - Title: "There is a problem"
  - Field errors list:
    - "Enter your National Insurance number"

Inline Field Errors (specific, helpful):
  - nationalInsuranceNumber: "Enter your National Insurance number in the correct format, like QQ 12 34 56 C"

## Content Design Standards

### Interface Writing Principles
```
Writing Style:
- Use "you" and "your" when service speaks to user
- Use "I", "me", "my" in form labels (user speaking)
- Start with most important information
- Use sentence case for everything
- One idea per sentence

Question Examples:
✅ "What is your date of birth?"
❌ "Please provide your date of birth for verification purposes"

✅ "Do you live at more than one address?"
❌ "Tell us about your living arrangements"

Button Text:
✅ "Continue" (not "Next" or "Submit")
✅ "Save and continue" (for optional questions)
✅ "Accept and send application"

Error Messages:
✅ "Enter your email address"
✅ "Enter a valid email address like name@example.com"
❌ "This field is required"
❌ "Invalid input"
```

### Help Text Strategy
Only add help text when user research shows users need it

hint: "We'll only use this to contact you about your application"

Help text explains:
1. Where to find information
2. What format we expect
3. Why we need it
4. How we'll use it
5. Consequences of their choice

## Accessibility Design Requirements

### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Checklist
```
✅ Color and Contrast:
- 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio for normal text
- 3:1 minimum for large text and interactive elements
- Information conveyed by color also conveyed by text/shape

✅ Keyboard Navigation:
- All interactive elements accessible by keyboard
- Visible focus indicators on all focusable elements
- Logical tab order through page content

✅ Screen Reader Support:
- Descriptive page titles
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3...)
- Form labels associated with inputs
- Error messages announced

✅ Motor Impairments:
- Click targets minimum 44x44px
- Sufficient spacing between interactive elements
- No time limits or generous time allowances

✅ Cognitive Support:
- Clear, simple language
- Consistent navigation and layout
- Error prevention and clear error recovery
```

## Component Design Patterns

### Complex Question Breakdown
```
Instead of: "What are your personal details?"
Break into:
1. "What is your full name?"
2. "What is your date of birth?"  
3. "What is your address?"
4. "What is your phone number?"
5. "What is your email address?"

Each page:
- Single focus
- Clear question
- Appropriate input type
- Contextual help if needed
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Design Anti-Patterns
- **Multiple questions per page**: Cognitive overload
- **Custom components without justification**: Inconsistent user experience
- **Complex language**: Excluding users with lower literacy
- **Color-only information**: Inaccessible to colorblind users
- **Tiny click targets**: Difficult for motor impairments

### Content Anti-Patterns
- **Asking unnecessary questions**: Privacy invasion and user frustration
- **Vague questions**: "Tell us about..." instead of specific questions
- **Technical language**: Government jargon users don't understand
- **Unhelpful error messages**: "Invalid input" instead of specific guidance

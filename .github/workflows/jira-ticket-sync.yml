            You are running in a GitHub Action for automated JIRA ticket planning.
            The environment has been set up and dependencies installed.
            You have access to JIRA via MCP tools (jira_search, jira_get_issue, jira_add_comment).
            You have access to the /expressjs-monorepo:wf-plan command from the hmcts/.claude marketplace.

            Automate JIRA ticket planning for prioritized backlog items.

            Task:
            1. Use jira_search to find all VIBE tickets with status "Prioritized Backlog"
            2. For each ticket, check if a branch feature/VIBE-[num]-[slug] exists
            3. For tickets without branches:
               a. Create the branch with appropriate slug from ticket title
               b. Run /expressjs-monorepo:wf-plan VIBE-[num] to generate technical planning
               c. Commit generated docs to the branch
               d. Push the branch to remote
               e. Extract a 2-3 sentence summary from the specification.md
               f. Use jira_add_comment to post the summary with links to:
                  - Branch URL
                  - Specification doc URL
                  - Tasks doc URL

            Important:
            - Process all tickets sequentially (not in parallel)
            - If a ticket fails, log the error and continue with next ticket
            - Include error handling for JIRA API failures
            - Format JIRA comments clearly with headings and links

            Process all tickets systematically and provide clear logging.

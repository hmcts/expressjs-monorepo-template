# Context: GDS Design Principles & Standards

The following principles from the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) must guide all outputs. When generating user stories, acceptance criteria, or technical designs, use these as your primary evaluation framework.

## 1. Start with user needs
* **The Goal:** Do not build based on business "wants." Identify the underlying user need first.
* **AI Instruction:** If a requirement lacks a clear user benefit, flag it as a risk.

## 2. Do less
* **The Goal:** Reuse existing patterns and platforms (GOV.UK Design System, Notify, Pay). 
* **AI Instruction:** Prioritize standard components over custom UI.

## 3. Design with data
* **The Goal:** Decisions must be evidence-based, not based on "gut feeling."
* **AI Instruction:** Include data-gathering steps or success metrics in ticket validation sections.

## 4. Do the hard work to make it simple
* **The Goal:** Don't pass complexity onto the user. Handle the heavy lifting in the backend.
* **AI Instruction:** Simplify user flows; eliminate unnecessary steps or input fields.

## 5. Iterate. Then iterate again
* **The Goal:** Release small, functional increments (MVP/Alpha) and refine based on feedback.
* **AI Instruction:** Structure tickets into the smallest possible deliverable units.

## 6. This is for everyone
* **The Goal:** Accessibility is non-negotiable. Services must work for everyone, including those with physical or cognitive impairments.
* **AI Instruction:** Ensure every ticket includes Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) criteria and ARIA considerations.

## 7. Understand context
* **The Goal:** Users may be stressed, in a hurry, or on a poor mobile connection.
* **AI Instruction:** Design for "low-bandwidth" and "high-stress" scenarios.

## 8. Build digital services, not websites
* **The Goal:** Look at the end-to-end service (including offline interactions), not just a standalone page.
* **AI Instruction:** Ensure navigation and error handling account for the "whole journey."

## 9. Be consistent, not uniform
* **The Goal:** Use the GOV.UK Design System patterns to ensure familiarity and trust.
* **AI Instruction:** Always align UI specs with GOV.UK standard components (Radios, Checkboxes, Details components).

## 10. Make things open: it makes things better
* **The Goal:** Share code and research to improve quality through public scrutiny.
* **AI Instruction:** Prioritize open-source tools and transparent documentation.

## 11. Minimise environmental impact
* **The Goal:** Optimize for efficiency to reduce carbon footprint.
* **AI Instruction:** Recommend lightweight code and efficient API calls.
